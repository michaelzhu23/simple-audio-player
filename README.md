I built this project as a way to learn and practice TypeScript.

### Getting started

Clone this repo.

You can use `npm` to install the dependencies and run the basic React project.

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Functionalities

- Can play through a playlist of audio files
- Display all tracks of the currently selected playlist
- Display info on the currently playing track and supporting basic functionality like play/pause, next track/previous track.

### Playlist data

The playlist data is stored in `src/data/playlists.json`. It includes a list of audio files and some associated metadata.
